## What is C?
C is a powerful and widely-used programming language that was created in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. It is known for its efficiency, portability, and low-level programming capabilities. C has greatly influenced the development of many other programming languages and operating systems.

## Getting Started
To start programming in C, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on your system.
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for C programming. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or CLion.
3. **C Libraries**: Familiarize yourself with C standard libraries like `<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`.

## Basic Syntax
C has a simple and concise syntax. Here's a classic "Hello, World!" program in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
