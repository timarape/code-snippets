## What is PHP?
PHP is a popular, server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is known for its ease of use, rapid development capabilities, and wide adoption in building dynamic and interactive web applications. PHP is embedded within HTML code and executed on the web server.

## Getting Started
To start programming in PHP, you'll need the following:
1. **Web Server**: Install a web server on your development machine. Popular choices include Apache, Nginx, or you can use a local development environment like XAMPP or WAMP.
2. **PHP**: Install the PHP interpreter on your web server or use a pre-packaged solution like XAMPP, which includes PHP, Apache, MySQL, and more.
3. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment suitable for PHP development. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, PhpStorm, and Sublime Text.
4. **PHP Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with PHP's syntax, functions, and official documentation (https://www.php.net/docs.php).

## Basic Syntax
PHP's syntax is similar to other C-style languages and is embedded within HTML. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in PHP:

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
