## What is Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language known for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency. It is designed to provide memory safety and prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and data races. Rust is used in various domains, including systems programming, game development, and web development.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Rust, you'll need the following:
1. **Rust Installation**: Install Rust on your system by following the instructions on the official website (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for Rust development. Popular options include Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension, IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust plugin, and Rust-specific editors like Rust-analyzer.
3. **Rust Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Rust's syntax, standard library, and official documentation (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Basic Syntax
Rust has a concise and expressive syntax. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
