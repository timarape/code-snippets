## What is Groovy?
Groovy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is designed to be concise, readable, and compatible with existing Java code. Groovy offers features such as closures, dynamic typing, and seamless integration with Java libraries, making it a popular choice for scripting, building applications, and enhancing Java applications.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Groovy, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install a Groovy distribution or SDK on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://groovy-lang.org/download.html).
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment suitable for Groovy programming. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA with the Groovy plugin, and Eclipse with the Groovy-Eclipse plugin.
3. **Groovy Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Groovy's syntax, features, and standard libraries. The official documentation is a great place to start (https://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html).

## Basic Syntax
Groovy's syntax is similar to Java, making it easy for Java developers to transition to Groovy. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Groovy:

```groovy
println 'Hello, World!'
