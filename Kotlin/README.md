## What is Kotlin?
Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Developed by JetBrains, Kotlin is known for its conciseness, safety, and interoperability with existing Java code. It is used for a wide range of applications, including Android app development, server-side development, and more.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Kotlin, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install a Kotlin-compatible IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, or Visual Studio Code with the Kotlin plugin.
2. **Kotlin Compiler**: You can use the Kotlin command-line compiler (`kotlinc`) for smaller projects or build tools like Gradle for larger ones.
3. **Kotlin Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Kotlin's syntax, standard library, and official documentation (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/).

## Basic Syntax
Kotlin's syntax is concise and expressive. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
