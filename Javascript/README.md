## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, and dynamically typed programming language that is primarily used for front-end web development. It enables interactivity and dynamic behavior in web applications. JavaScript can be run in web browsers and on the server-side using platforms like Node.js.

## Getting Started
To start programming in JavaScript, you'll need the following:
1. **Web Browser**: JavaScript can be executed in a web browser's developer console. All modern web browsers come with developer tools.
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for JavaScript development. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and WebStorm.
3. **Node.js**: If you plan to use JavaScript on the server-side, install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).
4. **JavaScript Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with JavaScript's syntax, built-in objects, and APIs. The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) offers comprehensive documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Basic Syntax
JavaScript's syntax is similar to C and C++, making it relatively easy to learn. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
