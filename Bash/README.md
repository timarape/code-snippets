## What is Bash?
Bash is a command-line shell and scripting language used in Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS, etc.). It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system and writing scripts to automate tasks.

## Getting Started
To start writing Bash scripts, you'll need a terminal or shell environment. Most Unix-like operating systems come with Bash pre-installed. Here are some resources to get started:
1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch a terminal or command prompt on your system.
2. **Text Editor**: Choose a text editor for writing Bash scripts. Popular options include Nano, Vim, and VSCode with Bash extensions.
3. **Bash Tutorial**: Familiarize yourself with Bash syntax and basic commands through online tutorials (e.g., [Bash Guide for Beginners](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html)).

## Basic Syntax
Bash scripts consist of a series of commands. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
