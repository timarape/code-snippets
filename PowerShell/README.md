## What is PowerShell?
PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework developed by Microsoft. It provides a command-line shell, scripting language, and automation engine. PowerShell is designed for managing and automating Windows environments but is also available for cross-platform use.

## Getting Started
To start scripting and automating with PowerShell, you'll need the following:
1. **Windows**: PowerShell is pre-installed on Windows. Ensure you have a recent version (e.g., PowerShell 7) for the latest features.
2. **Linux or macOS**: Install PowerShell Core from the official repository (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) for cross-platform use.
3. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for PowerShell scripting. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension, PowerShell ISE (Windows), or even Notepad.

## Basic Syntax
PowerShell uses a verb-noun naming convention for its commands, known as cmdlets. Here's an example of a basic cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-Process
