## What is Ruby?
Ruby is a dynamic, high-level, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and developer-friendly syntax. It is often used for web development, scripting, and automation tasks. Ruby is the language behind the Ruby on Rails web framework.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Ruby, you'll need the following:
1. **Ruby Installation**: Install Ruby on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for Ruby development. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, RubyMine, and Sublime Text.
3. **Ruby Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Ruby's syntax, standard libraries, and official documentation (https://ruby-doc.org/).
