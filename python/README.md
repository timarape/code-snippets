## What is Python?
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library. It is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Python, you'll need the following:
1. **Python Interpreter**: Install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python 3.x is the recommended version.
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment suitable for Python development. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Python Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Python's syntax, standard libraries, and official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/).

## Basic Syntax
Python has a clean and readable syntax. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
