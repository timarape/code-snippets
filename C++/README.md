## What is C++?
C++ is a versatile and widely-used programming language that extends the C programming language with features for object-oriented programming (OOP). C++ is known for its performance, efficiency, and extensive libraries. It is used in a variety of applications, including system programming, game development, and web development.

## Getting Started
To start programming in C++, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install a C++ compiler like g++ (GNU C++ Compiler) on your system.
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for C++ programming. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks.
3. **C++ Libraries**: Familiarize yourself with the C++ Standard Library, which includes essential components like containers and algorithms.

## Basic Syntax
C++ inherits much of its syntax from C. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
