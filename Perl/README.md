## What is Perl?
Perl is a versatile, high-level, and interpreted programming language known for its text processing capabilities, regular expression support, and powerful scripting features. It is often used for web development, system administration, and automation tasks.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Perl, you'll need the following:
1. **Perl Interpreter**: Perl comes pre-installed on most Unix-based systems. For Windows, you can download ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl.
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for Perl programming. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Perl-specific IDEs like Padre.
3. **Perl Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Perl's syntax, standard libraries, and official documentation (https://perldoc.perl.org/).

## Basic Syntax
Perl has a concise and expressive syntax. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Perl:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print "Hello, World!\n";
