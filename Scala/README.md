## What is Scala?
Scala is a modern, statically typed programming language designed for conciseness, expressiveness, and strong typing. It combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms and is known for its scalability and robustness. Scala is often used in building large-scale and high-performance systems.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Scala, you'll need the following:
1. **Scala Installation**: Install Scala on your system by following the instructions on the official website (https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).
2. **Text Editor or IDE**: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) suitable for Scala development. Popular options include Visual Studio Code with the Metals extension, IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin, and the Scala-specific IDE called ScalaIDE.
3. **Scala Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Scala's syntax, standard library, and official documentation (https://docs.scala-lang.org/).

## Basic Syntax
Scala's syntax is concise and expressive. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Scala:

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, World!")
  }
}
