## What is Java?
Java is a versatile, high-level, and object-oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is known for its platform independence, strong community support, and wide range of applications, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise software, and more.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Java, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system, which includes the Java compiler (`javac`) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE). You can download it from the official website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Choose a Java-friendly IDE for coding and debugging. Popular options include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Visual Studio Code with Java extensions.
3. **Java Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Java's standard libraries and official documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/).

## Basic Syntax
Java's syntax is C-like and relatively easy to read and write. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
