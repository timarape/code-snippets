Welcome to the C# Programming Language README! This document provides code-snippets for those interested in learning and working with C#.


## What is C#?
C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, versatile, and object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the .NET ecosystem and is commonly used for building desktop, web, and mobile applications. C# offers a robust set of features, including strong typing, garbage collection, and support for asynchronous programming.

## Getting Started
To start programming in C#, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, both of which provide excellent C# development support.
2. **.NET SDK**: Download and install the .NET SDK from the official website.

## Basic Syntax
C# has a C-style syntax, making it familiar to developers of languages like C, C++, and Java. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C#:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
