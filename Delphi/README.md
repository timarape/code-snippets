## What is Delphi?
Delphi is a modern, high-level programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) known for its ease of use and rapid application development (RAD) capabilities. Originally developed by Borland Software Corporation, it is now maintained by Embarcadero Technologies. Delphi is widely used for building Windows applications and supports cross-platform development through FireMonkey.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Delphi, you'll need the following:
1. **Development Environment**: Install Delphi or Embarcadero RAD Studio, which provides a comprehensive IDE for Delphi development.
2. **Delphi Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Delphi's components, libraries, and visual design tools.

## Basic Syntax
Delphi's syntax is Pascal-like and relatively easy to read and write. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Delphi:

```delphi
program HelloWorld;
begin
  Writeln('Hello, World!');
end.
