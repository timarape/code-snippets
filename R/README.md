## What is R?
R is a powerful and widely-used programming language and environment for statistical computing and data analysis. It provides a wide range of tools for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling. R is an open-source language with a strong community of users and developers.

## Getting Started
To start programming in R, you'll need the following:
1. **R Installation**: Download and install the R software from the official website (https://www.r-project.org/).
2. **RStudio (Optional)**: While not required, RStudio is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R more user-friendly. You can download it from the RStudio website (https://rstudio.com/).
3. **R Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with R's syntax, functions, and packages using the official documentation (https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

## Basic Syntax
R has a straightforward and flexible syntax. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in R:

```r
print("Hello, World!")
