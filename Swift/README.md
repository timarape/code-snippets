## What is Swift?
Swift is a powerful and user-friendly programming language developed by Apple. It is designed for building applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and more. Swift is known for its speed, safety, and expressive syntax.

## Getting Started
To start programming in Swift, you'll need the following:
1. **Xcode**: Install Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), from the Mac App Store. Xcode includes the Swift compiler and a rich set of development tools.
2. **Swift Playgrounds (Optional)**: For a more interactive learning experience, you can use Swift Playgrounds on iPad or macOS.
3. **Swift Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Swift's syntax, standard library, and official documentation (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/).

## Basic Syntax
Swift has a clean and concise syntax. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Swift:

```swift
print("Hello, World!")
