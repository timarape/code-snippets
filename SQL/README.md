## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data.

## Getting Started
To start using SQL, you'll need access to a relational database management system (DBMS) and a SQL client or interface. Here are some steps to get started:
1. **Choose a DBMS**: Select a DBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, or Oracle Database.
2. **Install and Set Up**: Install the chosen DBMS and follow its documentation to set up the database server.
3. **SQL Client**: Use a SQL client or interface to connect to the database server. Popular options include MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio, or command-line tools like `mysql` or `sqlite3`.
4. **Learn SQL**: Familiarize yourself with SQL syntax, database concepts, and commands through online tutorials and documentation.

## Basic SQL Syntax
SQL uses a structured syntax for querying databases. Here's a simple SQL statement that retrieves all records from a hypothetical "employees" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
